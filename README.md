# Personal Website/Portfolio

**Name: Lowella Fox**

**Description:** This is my Portfolio website.  

**Functionality:** The home page contains my name and my skills. You will see also a little bit of my information and qualifications.  In the about page that's where you will learn more about me, where I came from and etc. When you click the Portfolio page you will see my skills, the programming languages I know and the porfolio projects I have.  In the contact page that's where you can send me an email with your contact info.

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript 

**Future Improvement:**

1. Need to improve the design of the pages I guess.
2. Need to add button where the potential employer can download my resume.
3. Probably add search box to the page
