            <p>My name is Lowella Fox, a Filipina now based in Texas. I got my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of Cebu in the Philippines. With my focus and dedication to achieve my goals for me and my family. I had a career as a Software Developer in one of the IT Companies in the Philippines. While being there, I was sent to the company headquarters in Georgia for further training and skills enhancement.</p>
            <p>My work experience tested my capability to work independently and with a team. I have proven my reliability and resilience in any work situation, displaying proactiveness and good problem solver. I am also very keen on details; I make sure everything is done correctly and accurately.</p>
            <p>When I moved to Texas, I got a job in a different field, but I am aiming to get a Software Developer position again. I enrolled into a Junior Web Developer style boot camp with Generation USA to learn new insights, updates and techniques relevant to the field. I am diligently studying while juggling current job and my role as a wife and a mom to two adorable children. With hard work, focus and drive to succeed, thereâ€™s nothing impossible.</p>
